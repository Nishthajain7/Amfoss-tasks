For this task, I will document the open-source repository [Django-Poll-App](https://github.com/devmahmud/Django-Poll-App), which is a basic Django application for creating and managing polls. When I first looked at the code, it seemed confusing but I began by running the application on my system to understand its functionality. Next, I surfed the web to learn what each term meant, and started with the documentation. This task improved my technical writing and project documentation skills the so effort was worthwhile.
