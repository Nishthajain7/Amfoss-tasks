## Introduction
Heyy everyone <br>
I am Nishtha Jain from Hyderabad. I've always been interested in the field of artificial intelligence. The ability of a computer to perform tasks which were restricted to humans till date, drives me crazy. My curiosity has driven me into pursuing AI and Data Science.
## Why you must choose me
Having cleared the JEE Advanced examination, I believe I possess the following skillset:
<ul>
  <li>Observing problems carefully and understanding them.</li>
  <li>Breaking complex situations into smaller, simpler ones and connect the dots to reach to the final solution. </li>
  <li>Thinking of not just one but multiple solutions to a given problem.</li>
  <li>I'm habituated to sit for long hours amd tackle even the difficult problems with patiene and remembering to use the fundamentals.</li>
  <li>I will use a different approach if I am unable to proceed further.</li>
</ul>
Apart from this, when it comes to programming, I cannot be at peace until my work is done. To me, completing your work and going to bed with relief is the best feeling ever!

## How would you contribute back to the club?

I would contribute back to the amFOSS club by sharing my knowledge and skills with other members, and working together on collaborative projects. I can offer to help organize coding competitions or hackathons, and provide mentorship to newer members.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?
I am interested in web development and machine learning. <br>
Web development fascinates me because it requires creativity in designing user interfaces and solving real-world problems. In order to work on web development, I am trying to build a strong grip on Java.<br>
Machine learning excites me because of its intelligent decision-making. I have been making simple projects using the python libraries.
