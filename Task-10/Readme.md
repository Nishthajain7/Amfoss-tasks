# HERO-DEX

I started by reading flutter documentations to get a basic understanding on how flutter works. Next, i referred [Pokedex](https://github.com/TheAlphamerc/flutter_pokedex) for an example that was similar to this task. After outlining the structure of this app, I noticed that styling in Flutter was similar to CSS except that it uses rows and columns instead of divs, which helps in arrangement of the elements
